/**
 * Allows for usage of SCSI-based storage devices like they were bare standard SATA ones
 *
 * WHY THIS SHIM?
 * Normally Linux doesn't care if something is an SCSI device or a SATA one, as SATA is a subset of SCSI (technically
 * speaking SATA is an interface using SCSI protocol). However, the syno-modified SCSI driver (drivers/scsi/sd.c) adds
 * a layer of logical disk types. These types determine what the disk actually is, so that the NAS can know what should
 * be done with them.
 * For example SYNO_DISK_USB, SYNO_DISK_SYNOBOOT, SYNO_DISK_SATA, and SYNO_DISK_ISCSI are all normally visible in the
 * system as /dev/sdX and are all SCSI-based drives. However, you can only use RAID on SATA drives and not on USB ones.
 * The "SYNO_DISK_SATA" is kind-of a catch-all type for all disks which are used for storing data, even if they're not
 * really SATA disks. One of the exceptions set by the sd.c driver is that if VirtIO driver is used all disks connected
 * via that method are treated as SYNO_DISK_SATA. Unfortunately that, very logical and useful, assumption is made ONLY
 * when the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_SYNO_KVMX64 (which is a special platform for VDSM). On all other platforms
 * disks connected to VirtIO will be slightly broken in old versions and unusable in newer ones (as their tpe is set to
 * SYNO_DISK_UNKNOWN). This shim brings the functionality available on CONFIG_SYNO_KVMX64 to all platforms.
 * In addition, it changes SAS ports to be SATA as well as syno reserves SYNO_DISK_SAS for usage with just a few FS
 * devices and external enclosures.
 *
 * HOW DOES IT WORK?
 * It simply plugs into the SCSI driver (via SCSI notifier) and waits for a new drive. When a new drive is connected it
 * checks if it was connected via the VirtIO driver or through a SAS card driver and changes the port type to
 * SYNO_PORT_TYPE_SATA, which will later force the driver to assume the drive is indeed a "SATA" drive (SYNO_DISK_SATA).
 * While the ports can be enumerated and changed all at once, it's safer to do it per-drive basis as drivers allow for
 * ports to be dynamically reconfigured and thus the type may change. This is also why we make no effort of
 * restoring port types after this shim is unregistered.
